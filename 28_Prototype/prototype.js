/* Prototype : a prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties. 
               Every JavaScript object has a prototype, and when you access a property 
               on an object, if the property is not found on the object itself, JavaScript 
               looks for it in the object's prototype, and so on, up the prototype chain.
